#+Title: Sunday Vespers, as used at St. Joseph's, Gateshead

This repository holds vespers booklets suitable for congregation and choir,
according to the sadly limited rubrics of the 1962 books (i.e. antiphons are not
doubled).

This repository is semi-automated.  For more information see the [[https://OfficiumDivinum.github.io/SundayVespers][documentation]].
