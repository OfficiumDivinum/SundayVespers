#+Title: Compline with the vulgate psalter, largely according to the 1962 rubrics

Compline for singing.  I have, rather naughtily, used the ancient
form of the hymn (which the Benedictines preserve), and drawn some
proper melodies from the Bendectine /antiphonale monasticum/.

If you would like this in any other format (or you have found an
error), please open an issue.

Needless to say, files in this folder are in Latin.  I may get round
to adding translations at some point.

Looking for the pdf?  Click on the latest release, to the right.  Pdfs
are built with github actions.

(The slightly over-the-top layout in this repository is for historic
reasons, but it should make it easier to add e.g. vespers if you
wished to.  I have another project afoot to make generating booklets
for the office an automatic process: Iâ€™ll add back here when that is
ready.)
