The remainder of this documentation is for people who want to edit the booklets, or make new booklets. Technical Description This repository is not fully automated. (A fully automated solution for producing booklets to sing any office is planned as part of the OfficiumDivinum project.) Instead it aims to make producing booklets by hand as little tedious as possible. Every booklet is in a self-contained directory, with a main latex file ( vespers.tex ), a file for the propers propers.tex and, optionally, a file containing the psalms ( psalms.tex ), and a makefile which handles building the booklet. No output files are committed to version control. Rather, on every push to master (which includes every pull request) the entire repository is rebuilt with Github Actions 1 . If the push is tagged , a release is created with all the pdfs attached; if not they are available as run artefacts from the 'Actions' tab on github. In this way one does not need texlive/gregorio installed locally, and output is consistent. Modifying the typography To change the layout, edit vespers.tex . It is a very standard LaTeX file using memoir , so modification should be easy. I have deliberately not tried to provide a general solution for every use case, so occasional manual input to prevent ugly typography may be required. If the modification is designed to be universal , you will have to delete and replace vespers.tex in every single directory. Please do not be tempted to symlink: it is important to be able to intervene manually as required. TeX is designed to help human typesetters, not to replace them. Modifying an extant booklet If you have spotted a mistake in a booklet, or just want to change something in the content , edit propers.tex (or psalms.tex ). These files provide the macros which are substituted into vespers.tex at compile time. If you want to edit a chant , edit the corresponding .gabc file, as described below. If you have only a small change, the easiest way is to find the file in question in github's web interface, click the pencil icon to edit the file, edit as required, and then enter a short description of the change and commit. Creating a new booklet With Cookiecutter (preferred) Install cookiecutter if you do not already have it. cookiecutter vespers-template -o vespers/ And enter a name for the feast. This will create a directory with a sensible name and populate it with the correct files. Manually Copy vespers-template/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}} to a sensibly named directory. Insert the feast name in propers.tex . Edit anything else inside {{}} and remove any directives inside {% %} . Adding Content Begin by collecting all the antiphons, and saving the .gabc files as antN.gabc (e.g. ant1.gabc ). Most everything gregorian can be found at gregobase . Ensure the mode and termination is specified in the antiphon file. The termination should be in the mode-differentia field, as according to the gregorio documentation this expresses: The mode or tone differentia of the piece. Typically, this expresses the variant of the psalm tone to use for the piece. Run ../../psalm_parser.py antN.gabc PSALM_NAME for every antiphon. This will parse the antiphon file, find the right psalm in the relevant mode, format it correctly and drop the resulting .gabc file in the current directory with the correct name. PSALM_NAME is the name of the psalm as in the psalms/ directory. If you want the solemn version of the tone add --solemn . Add translations for everything. I know of no reliable source of translations at the moment, although OfficiumDivinum aspires to become one. Thus I generally translate myself, or edit some available source. Optionally, compile locally by running make in the directory to check everything works. Push upstream with a new tag to generate a new release (if you have not checked locally, perhaps push without a tag first to check it works). If you do not have push access, open a pull request and one of the admins will merge it. We use the excellent texlive docker image maintained by Xu Cheng . TexLive now has a recent gregorio in it. \u21a9","title":"Usage"},{"location":"#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"#getting-the-booklets","text":"All booklets are available as releases allowing you to select the desired version (hint: unless you need conformity with an older pagination, you probably just want the latest).

The gregorio project makes setting chant extremely easy; TeX and LaTeX make producing beautiful booklets as easy as writing a markup language dreamed up in the days when redefining a looping macro to null to get out of a loop seemed reasonable, and GitHub will host anything and build anything, hopefully for the indefinite future. This repository is designed to make it easy to tinker . I have deliberately avoided trying to automate everything. Each booklet makes sense by hand: the propers are defined as macros in propers.tex , the layout is in vespers.tex and there is a makefile so you don't have to remember how to compile.
